Crouching Alchemist Hidden Panda (CALCHIPAN)
============================================

===========

A `SQLAlchemy <http://www.sqlalchemy.org/>`_ dialect which will

`Me <https://twitter.com/zzzeek/status/313405747134357505>`_: Naive Pandas idea #1: map SQLAlchemy declarative classes to pandas dataframes, use ORM or core queries to query it. Pointless?

`Wes McKinney <https://twitter.com/wesmckinn/status/313412273043537920>`_: @chriswithers13 @zzzeek integration layers = good

From the man himself, and a Pycon sprint project was born!
